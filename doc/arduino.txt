For using Arduino in IrScrutinizer, checkout
https://github.com/bengtmartensson/AGirs, compile and flash the
GirsLite sketch in src/GirsLite. For this, the contained library src/GirsLib,
should be copied/moved/linked to the Arduino library area, typically
~/Arduino/libraries or C:\Arduino\libraries.

Previous versions contained a directory IrScrutinizer/arduino. This
has been deleted; is replaced by AGirs.
