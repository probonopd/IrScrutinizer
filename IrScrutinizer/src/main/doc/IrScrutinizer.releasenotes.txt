Version 1.1.3
- New implementation of MacOS App build, without proprietary stuff.
- Cleaned up version management in poms.
- SendingHardwareManager: handle exceptions in select better.
- LircClient: nuke trailing (and leading) spaces before comparision.
- Helptext and documentation update.
- Made file/tree importer more intuitive: tree cleared when invalid.
  "Import all" and "Import all/raw" disabled when more than 10 remotes in tree.
- Importers now import remotes with some of the commands erroneous
    or unparseable. These are just "ignored", instead of causing an abort.
- Read CML files as WINDOWS-1252 (educated guess).
- Removed external dependency of de.moldaner.wakeonlan
- Robustness fix in AmxBeaconListener.
- Explicitly set Java source and target version to 1.7.
- Minor fixes in IrPlotter: Wrote help text. Clone plot now in popup
  menu. New public function IrPlotter.createPopupClone().
- Implemented Cml- and CommandFusion-import.
- TreeImporter: when a remote node is expanded, decode its children,
  i.e. its commands.
- Sort the remotes in TreeImporter alphabetically.
- Switch to busy cursor in FileImporterBean.loadFileButtonActionPerformed().
- Removed Option -> Output text format -> UEI Learned.
    Reason: Very little use, high confusion potential.
- Support for the CommandFusion Learner, sending and capturing
- Layout fix: increased width of module & port combos for global cache.
- sometimes erroneous HardwareUnvailableException when using GlobalCache.
- New protocol Roku-Official, contributed by mdavej.
- Robustness improvement (resolve symlinks to device etc).
- Fixed bug in Import/Text/Parametrized: Field separators erroneous.

Version 1.1.2
- On Unix-like systems, can now be installed on the local machen by
  "mvn deploy". 
- Now both Fedora rpm version and a Mac OS X app!
- Sources available at Github
  (https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle). Reorganized as
  Maven project.
- Now using the babelfish icon. Remove icons with unclear legal status.
- New command line option --nuke-properties.
- Use the (new?) Crystal-Clear icons instead of the (old?) crystal.
- Fixed bug in Lirc/NEC1-exporter: when S was missing, replacement S
  was being reversed twice.
- Now the debug code can be set from GUI: Options -> Debug -> Debug Code...
- Loading of the "local" jni libraries now from subdirs of apphome.
- Removed pdf files and the glossary (at least for now) -- makes
  distribution and packaging easier.
- Removed a few unneeded documentation links under help.
- Lirc exports now get the extension .lircd.conf, since that extension
  is now used by the Lirc project. Also, when importing Lirc files,
  the extension .conf is possible.
- (IrpProtocols.ini) "New" protocols Sharp{1} and Sharp{2}.
- Removed dead command line options
- Adhere to Freedesktop configuration files standards: 
  http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
  (on other platforms than Windows).
- New Menuitems Help->Release notes.
- Import and export in Lirc Mode2 format

Version 1.1.1
- New export format: IrToy-bin
- New importer: IrTrans
- Fix bug in Hexcalc when number > 65535.
- Splash screen on startup.
- Multiple decodes from DecodeIR are no longer "censored" (in all places).
- Parametric remote -> Advanced -> "Set misc. parameters" now replaces
all old parameters except D, S, F, and T. 
- Fixed unclear semantic of "count" sends of an IrSignal.
- Fixed issue with sending by IrToy.

Version 1.1.0a.
- IrToy: fixed several issues. (Only FW version 222 is supported.)
- the count for transmit generated is now a saved property.
- csv-importer: can now parse hexadecimal numbers starting with 0x.

Version 1.1.0.
- Arduino: handle timeouts from serial port better.
- Smarter scrolling of Scrutinize remote tables.
- Individual silly commands are now forgiven (ignored) in rmdu import.
- If an import to a fails, clear the associated tree -- it is
confusing to leave something from another import as-is.
- Option "Output text format" now defaults to CCF.
- Improved Arduino-support, using "Arduino GirsLite" (see
arduino/GirsLite/README), new ArduinoInterface to new Arduino firmware.
- CSV-import, raw and parametrized: New option "multi column name".
- Support the improved API of IRDB, thus the performace problems are fixed.
- Implemented Set Misc Params in Parametric remote.
- The option "Invoke Analyzer on Imports" renamed to "Invoke
Analyzer". Menu option moved to Options (was Options->Import
options). It now governs the invokation of the analyzer not only on
import but also on scrutinization of individual signals.
- Changing export directory sometimes did not take effect until after
a restart, see
http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=14986&start=21
- Nasty bug when capturing GlobalCaches where not initialized fixed,
see http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=11769&start=71
- New export text format: short CCF.
- Generate D, S, and F now saved to properties.
- Implemented offerStackTrace, offering stack traces by exception
popups.
- If scrutinizing a signal containing durations of zero length,
refuse, and allow the user to enter a replacement value.
- The option "Invoke Analyzer on Imports" renamed to "Invoke
Analyzer". Menu option moved to Options (was Options->Import
options). It now governs the invokation of the analyzer not only on
import but also on scrutinization of individual signals.

Version 1.0.1
- Now possible to select baud rate for serial sending/capturing
devices (Arduino, IrToy).
- Included Michael Dreher's "Ir_Widget" capture software for Arduio.
- New command line option: -x|--experimental, used to selectively
show/hide "experimental" features. (Cannot be switched from GUI.) For
now, the generic serial IR command sender is only showed when this
option is selected.

Version: 1.0.0:
- Importing CSV parametrized and raw is now possible from clipboard.
- (HarcHardware) Fixed file descriptor leak in the
AmxBeaconListener/GlobalCacheListener.
- If editing (open last export) fails, fall back to "open".
- Remove prefiltering when importing Girr (only GUI elements were
implemented)
- Generating: Bugs, (e.g. misbehavior when no D present in protocol), fixed.
- CCF of type 0100 are now parsed.
- Fixed bug when pressing cancel for createUser.
- now inquires for device data (manufacturer etc) when exporting
commands, can be turned off by Options -> Export options -> Inquire
device data.
- New option: "Ignore T on parametric learns".
- Parameters in the parametrized table can now be removed by entering an empty string
- The sequences in the raw table are now really read-only, previously
they could be manipulated, but the changes did not take
effect. (Editing could be implemented, but is probably not worth it.)
- Text importers now makes command names unique by appending "$" and a
number if necessary.
- Now a class IrpMaster for firing up the commmand line IrpMaster.
- If option Import/Open ZIP files is selected, will import from zip
files directly.


2012-12-01: Version 0.1.1
- appHome and java.library.path now computed dynamically. Thus the
windows start-up wrapper has been eliminated.
- New export formats: spreadsheet, RMFunctions, ICT.
- Cloning of plot implemented (but rather primitive).
- New export formats: ICT, Spreadsheet, and RMFunctions.
- Improved documentation and help texts.
- Added glossary.
- Improved startup of the serial stuff: Now searches for all serial
  ports, but only once (by caching). (On windows, cases somewhat slow
  startup :-\ )
- Misc bug fixes, layout fixes, cleanups.

2012-11-12: Version 0.1.0
Very first version with many rough edges. Not tested very
much. Documentation not written. Popup texts also not written.

Known issues:
      Documentation largely missing.
      Popop help texts not written
      Serial communication generally unreliable. Plan: replace rxtx.
      Generally rough layout.
      Some glitches in the IR plotter, like sometimes silly time scale.
